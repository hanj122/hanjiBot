# hanjibot
my active discord bot atm.
removed links for privacy reasons. (commands linked with a url won't work)
you can delete lines 12 and 13 as they are not used in this bot.

HOW TO RUN:
1. install python and ffmpeg to path.
2. type the ff to terminal:
- pip install nextcord
- pip install gTTS
- pip install ffmpeg-python
3. copy and paste your token to Bot_token.py from discord developer portal (turn on admin role)
- save both invite link and token in a notepad
4. lastly, type "python main.py" in terminal :)
